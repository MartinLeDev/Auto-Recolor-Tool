# Select the image recoloring algorithm you prefer
Hue shifting is highly reccomended, but tinting can be useful for brute forcing color overlays on darker images

It is highly recommended you click the "Change Export Path" button to control where exported recolor packs write to.
The "View Configs" and "View Exports" buttons opens the folders in file explorer where configs and exported recolors are saved to.
# Adding a config

<br>
<br>
Pressing the View Configs button opens your configs folder in roaming app data, unlike the export folder, this folder location can never be changed.
<br>
To add configs simply create txt files with any name and start writing each file name you want to be automatically recolored on individual lines.
<br>
Use the image above as a reference guide, this exact default txt config will be generated on start.
<br>
Do not worry about the export.config, that is where your exported packs path data is saved.

In the settings tab click Apply Config, then check off all the desired configs. Finally, press Apply Selected Configs

<br>
<br>
To export a pack once you have finished recoloring it, press the Build Pack button and enter a pack name.
<br>
The pack will then build to your export folder. When done, an alert message will appear informing you of the path the pack was exported to.
